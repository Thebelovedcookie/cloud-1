# ☁️ Cloud-1 Project – Summary

The **Cloud-1** project is an introduction to **Cloud Computing** and **infrastructure management**.  
Its main purpose is to teach students how to **deploy, configure, secure, and automate** a scalable infrastructure in the cloud.

---

## 🎯 Main Objectives
- Understand Cloud fundamentals: virtualization, scalability, high availability, and pay-as-you-go models.  
- Deploy a web service on a Cloud provider (commonly **AWS**).  
- Automate deployment using **Ansible** (configuration management).
- Set up essential services:
  - Virtual machines (EC2)  
  - Reverse proxy with **Nginx**  
  - **SSL/TLS certificates** (Let’s Encrypt)  
  - Managed databases (Mariadb, phpmyadmin)  
- Ensure **security**: access management, certificates, encryption.  
- Guarantee **resilience**: redundancy and fault tolerance for better uptime.

## 🔧 Technical Requirements
- Infrastructure described as **code**, fully reproducible.  
- A **deployed service** accessible via **HTTPS**.  
- Use of **automation tools** rather than manual setup.  

---

## 📄 Expected Deliverables
- A **working cloud infrastructure**.  
- A **web application or service** accessible online.  
- **Documentation** describing:
  - The chosen architecture  
  - The services used  
  - Steps to reproduce the setup
